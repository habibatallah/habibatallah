Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Habibatallah amr, and I am a highly motivated and passionate computer science professional with a deep love for programming and technology. I study CompSci, which has given me a strong foundation in the fundamental principles of software development, algorithms, and data structures. I'm proficient in Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript.

I'm currently a Software Engineer Intern, and this internship has helped me learn more about OOP, SOLID, and Database Systems using SQL, Java Spring, and Hibernate.
